## ❓Why?

- If you look down, you might miss out on some code getting inserted by your quick caffeine induced coding fingers! I'd be a real shame if that happend when you are in the wrong mode 🤦
I made this plugin so I could see which mode Neovim is in just by the color of CursorColumn.

## 🫣 Setup

```lua
    {
        todo = 'add some necessary config'
    }
```

## 👏 Acknowledgments

Neovim is growing a nice ecosystem, but some parts of plugin development are sometimes obscure. This template is an attempt to put together best practices by copying:

- [S1M0N38/my-awesome-plugin.nvim](https://github.com/ellisonleao/nvim-plugin-template) - *Plugin Structure* I used this to generate the structure of this plugin. Thanks S1M0N38! ❤️
